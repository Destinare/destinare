## Project Description

Have you ever wondered what you can do in a city you are traveling to but have been overwhelmed by searching multiple websites? Destinare is a proxy API that displays information about a specific location. You can search it for details on the weather, parks, events and more. Pair this app with your favorite travel site for optimal use.
